# Implementation Summary: Managed Profiles and Apps

## Overview
Added support for `managed_profiles` and `managed_apps` array keys to Cimian for Microsoft Store app and configuration profile deployment via Graph API pipeline integration.

## Files Modified

### 1. Core Manifest Processing (`pkg/manifest/manifest.go`)
**Changes:**
- Added `ManagedProfiles []string` and `ManagedApps []string` to `ManifestFile` struct
- Added `ManagedProfiles []string` and `ManagedApps []string` to `ConditionalItem` struct  
- Added `ManagedProfiles []string` and `ManagedApps []string` to `Item` struct
- Updated `EvaluateConditionalItems()` function signature to return 6 arrays instead of 4
- Added processing logic for the new arrays in conditional evaluation
- Added processing logic for the new arrays in main manifest processing with "profile" and "app" actions

### 2. Predicates Package (`pkg/predicates/predicates.go`)
**Changes:**
- Added `ManagedProfiles []string` and `ManagedApps []string` to `ConditionalItem` struct
- Updated `EvaluateConditionalItems()` function signature to return 6 arrays instead of 4
- Added processing logic for the new arrays in conditional evaluation

### 3. Package Info Generation (`cmd/makepkginfo/main.go`)
**Changes:**
- Added `ManagedProfiles []string` and `ManagedApps []string` to `PkgsInfo` struct
- Added `ManagedProfiles []string` and `ManagedApps []string` to `wrapperPkgsInfo` struct

### 4. Installation Processing (`pkg/installer/installer.go`)
**Changes:**
- Added support for "profile" and "app" actions in the `Install()` function
- Profile and app actions return success messages indicating they are scheduled for Graph API deployment
- No actual installation is performed (handled by external Graph API pipeline)

### 5. Main Software Update (`cmd/managedsoftwareupdate/main.go`)
**Changes:**
- Added `ManagedProfiles` and `ManagedApps` fields to manifest loading in `loadLocalOnlyManifest()`
- Updated logging to include counts of profiles and apps

### 6. Reporting System (`pkg/reporting/reporting.go`)
**Changes:**
- Updated `inferItemType()` function to handle "profile" and "app" event types
- Maps to "managed_profiles" and "managed_apps" item types for reporting

## Key Features Implemented

### ✅ Deduplication and Exclusion
- Built-in deduplication logic prevents duplicate entries across arrays
- Uses same pattern as existing managed arrays (`action|packagename` key)
- Automatically handles conflicts between manifests

### ✅ Conditional Support
- Full NSPredicate-style conditional evaluation support
- Can conditionally deploy profiles/apps based on hostname, domain, architecture, etc.
- Supports AND/OR logic for complex conditions

### ✅ Integration Points
- Items processed through normal Cimian workflow
- Logged with appropriate event types ("profile", "app")
- Reported in standard Cimian reporting structure
- Ready for Graph API pipeline consumption

### ✅ Backwards Compatibility
- Existing manifests continue to work unchanged
- New arrays are optional (omitempty tags)
- No breaking changes to existing functionality

## Testing
- ✅ Code compiles successfully for `makepkginfo` and `managedsoftwareupdate`
- ✅ All modified packages build without errors
- ✅ New array fields properly defined with YAML tags
- ✅ Function signatures consistent across packages

## Usage Examples

### Basic Manifest
```yaml
name: "corporate-baseline"
managed_installs:
  - "Firefox"
managed_profiles:
  - "CompanySecurityProfile" 
managed_apps:
  - "Microsoft Teams"
```

### Conditional Deployment
```yaml
name: "conditional-deployment"
conditional_items:
  - condition:
      key: "hostname"
      operator: "LIKE"
      value: "DEV-*"
    managed_profiles:
      - "DeveloperProfile"
    managed_apps:
      - "Microsoft Visual Studio"
```

## Next Steps for Graph API Pipeline Integration

1. **Pipeline Development**: Create service to monitor Cimian reports for profile/app events
2. **Graph API Integration**: Implement Microsoft Graph API calls for:
   - Configuration profile deployment
   - Microsoft Store app installation
3. **Status Feedback**: Update Cimian logs with deployment status from Graph API
4. **Testing**: Validate end-to-end workflow with sample profiles and apps

## Documentation
- Created comprehensive guide: `docs/managed-profiles-apps-guide.md`
- Includes usage examples, integration points, and troubleshooting
- Covers migration scenarios and operational considerations

The implementation provides a solid foundation for Graph API-based profile and app deployment while maintaining consistency with existing Cimian patterns and workflows.
